.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The 
.B datalog
program provides a lightweight deductive database system.  Queries and
database updates are expressed using Datalog\-a declarative logic
language in which each formula is a function-free Horn clause, and
every variable in the head of a clause must appear in the body of the
clause.  The use of Datalog syntax and an implementation based on
tabling intermediate results, ensures that all queries terminate.  The
program reads and executes the assertions and queries in
.IR FILE ,
or enters interactive mode if an input file is not given.
